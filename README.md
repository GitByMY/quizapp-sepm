# Inquizitive

## Description
Inquizitive is a quiz web app I built to help me learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I started with [a tutorial from the YouTube channel EasyTutorials](https://youtu.be/PBcqGxrr9g8) and wanted to add some of my own ideas to it to make the app even more fun for me to use as well as create!

## Features
Below are the features that I implemented myself:
+ Feels and can be used like a native mobile app
+ A home page separate from the quiz game that can also be returned to at any point during the quiz game
+ Multiple quiz subjects and the ability to select and take a specific quiz
+ A background that changes color each time the home page is displayed and each time the quiz page is displayed
